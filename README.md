# Computition Offloading and Resource Allocation with PPO

This project utilizes deep reinforcement learning methods for computation offloading and resource allocation in edge computing  systems. The usage instructions for the code are as follows:

### 1. Install Dependencies:

Before running the code, please make sure that the required dependencies for the project have been installed. You can use the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install the Gym environment 

You can install the Gym environment by using the `setup.py` file in the gym-md1 folder:

```shell
python setup.py install
```

### 3. Run the code:

You can directly run the `ppo-md1.py` file in the PPO folder to execute the code. You can use the following command to run the code:

```shell
python PPO/ppo-md1.py
```

### 4. Check the results

You can use TensorBoard to view the results of the code execution, and the results might look something like this:
